# ADKPreviewWidget
A model preview widget made purely with blueprints which works well with the Ark Development Kit

This is not a feature complete widget, but it has all the features I needed. Feel free to add pull requests with new features

In order for this work, you must add an instance of the `SceneCaptureActor` into your level. Simply drag it into the level, place it literally anywhere, and you're good to go. 

The widget which displays the model is `ModelPreview`

# Troubleshooting

**The widget doesn't compile when I first open**

On your first time using this widget, you may need to compile `SceenCaptureActor`, and then restart your ADK.
